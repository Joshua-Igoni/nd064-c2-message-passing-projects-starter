The app is divided into;
kafka cluster
location grpc
the rest APIs:
person api
location api
connection api

The kafka cluster is used to accomodate large volumes of data that may be generated from
either the location_grpc or/and location api through the users of the application. And also to store the data in such a manner that 
applications reading the data will not experience any lagging or downtime.

The locations grpc basically helps in the performance of the application by increasing speed of 
proccessing.

The location api will serve along side the location grpc to accomodate the choices of different consumers.
and also the person api and connection api will serve there purpose as restful APIs since the company is running 
on a limited budget. it wouldnt be cost effective to over design at this point.
